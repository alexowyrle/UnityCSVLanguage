# UnityCSVLanguage
To make it work we just need to do two things.
The first is go into the _CSV folder, Resources, and in the GameObject type the route where the CSV is (or change it to make it from Application.dataPath).
Then we need to add the CSVText script to any TextMeshPro text. You can change it very easily to make it work with Unity text.
There is also a method inside the CSVLanguage script to change the language midgame.
You do NOT need to instantiate the GameObject in the scene. It will be called automatically.
